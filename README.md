👋🏾 Hi, I’m Tashiana Osborne, @OsborneSci.

🌊 I’m interested in applying atmospheric, oceanic, and hydrologic research, tools, and datasets to address societal problems (geoscience to action).

🌱 Currently, I'm learning how to apply the NASA Land Information System (LIS) to support the Malaria Early Warning System (MEWS) in the Amazon Rainforest region of South America. I'm also investigating ocean-atmosphere related drivers of extreme precipitation and flooding in Amazonia - which also both affect mosquito behavior and malaria risk.  

✨ My dissertation focused on extreme variations in the radar-derived rain-snow transition elevation during atmospheric river storms, and extreme precipitation in the western U.S.
