👋🏾 Hi, I’m Tashiana Osborne, @OsborneSci.

🌊 I’m interested in applying atmospheric, oceanic, and hydrologic research, tools, and datasets within interdisciplinary projects that help address societal problems - Geoscience to Action.

🌱 Currently, I'm a postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins University. I'm applying the NASA Land Information System to support a Malaria Early Warning System designed for the Amazon Rainforest region of South America. I'm also investigating ocean-atmosphere related drivers of extreme precipitation and flooding in Amazonia - events that can influence mosquito behavior and malaria risk.  

✨ My Ph.D. dissertation at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (UC San Diego) focused on extreme variations in the radar-derived rain-snow transition elevation during atmospheric river storms, and extreme precipitation in the western U.S.
